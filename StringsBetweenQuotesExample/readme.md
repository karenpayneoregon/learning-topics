# About


Here is an example of extracting tokens in a string between double quotes. The first attempt extracts tokens but keeps starting and ending quotes. Yet suppose starting and ending quotes need to be removed. Rather than modify the first version, create a second version so we still have a working version and make appropriate changes. Once satisfied either remove the first version and rename the second version by removing the 1 or keep both versions. Then another idea is to merge the two versions with a parameter to indicate keeping or discarding the quotes.

The lesson explains how a developer might approach a given task. In the above, a developer now has two options to choose from: keep one version or keep all. My preference is to keep the version with the option to keep or discard quotes with one alteration and have a default for keeping or discarding quotes.
