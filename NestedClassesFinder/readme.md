# About

This project generates a `.filenesting.json` for a partial class in another project.

The `.filenesting.json` is created in this project debug folder.

# Usage

Change the `path` variable in the `Program.cs` file to point to the project containing the partial class.

The code will search all folders in the target project for files that match the partial classes.
